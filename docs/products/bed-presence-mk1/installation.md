# Installation

## Choose your installation method

The [Bed Presence Mk1](https://www.elevatedsensors.com/products/bed-presence-mk1) base kit includes everything needed to
install on beds with standard slats.

- Bed support must be slats or a foundation with slats.
- Slat must be at least 1" wide.
- Space between slats must be at least 2.5".
- The preferred mounting method is a screw into a wooden slat, but mounting tape may be used with metal slats.

If your bed uses a box spring, upholstered base, solid platform, foundation, or doesn't meet the requirements above,
you’ll need the [Universal Mounting Kit](https://www.elevatedsensors.com/products/bed-presence-universal-mounting-kit)
to ensure reliable performance on your bed.

## Base Slat Install
1. Remove mattress from bed frame.

1. Select a bed slat in the torso region, where most of your weight will be applied to the bed (think about where you
sit or lay in bed). If possible, select a bed slat that does not rock side to side.
1. Orient the sensor with the circuit board/text facing up, and the thicker part of the device hanging over the edge of
the bed slat. If the selected slat can move, you may need to screw it in place.

1. Firmly attach the device using the provided screw. Pre-drill if necessary. For metal slats, use the included
double-sided mounting square (it may be easier to insert the sensor strips before applying the adhesive square).

1. Insert the sensor strips, then peel the adhesive backing and affix the sensors to the bed slat. For a temporary
setup, sensors may be gently taped in place around bed slat. Do not cover end of sensors with tape, as there is a
required vent opening. For King beds, consider using the included extension wires to space the sensors futher apart.
Zip ties can be used to hold everything neatly in place.

1. Connect USB-C power.

1. Carefully place the mattress back in place. This may require 2 people, as dragging the mattress across the sensors
may dislodge them.

## Mounting Kit Install

### Queen/Full & Twin

1. Remove the flexible slat from the packaging and lay it on a flat surface such as a carpet.
1. Align the main unit cradle under the center hole of the slat.

1. Place the main unit into the cradle and loosely attach it using the blunt-tip screw.

1. Insert the sensor strips into the slots labeled “Left Sensor” and “Right Sensor”.
    - For the Twin Kit, attach the sensor to whichever side is most convenient based on your installation location.

1. Fully tighten the screw until the main unit is secure and no longer moves easily.
    - Do not overtighten, as this may strip the plastic.
1. Peel off the adhesive backing on each sensor strip and firmly stick them down.
1. Connect USB-C power. The unit is now ready to install on top of a box spring, upholstered base, solid platform, or foundation.
    - For beds with wooden slats or platforms, optionally use the provided wood screws to secure the ends of the flexible slat in place.

### King

1. Remove the flexible slat from the packaging and lay it on a flat surface such as a carpet.
1. Align the main unit cradle under the center hole of the slat.

1. Insert the sensor extension wires into the slots labeled “Left Sensor” and “Right Sensor”.

    <img src="/assets/images/bed-presence-mk1/bp-mount-install/4-extension_wires.jpg" width="400"/>

1. Fully tighten the screw until the main unit is secure and no longer moves easily.
    - Do not overtighten, as this may strip the plastic.
1. Connect the sensor strips to the ends of the extension wires.

    <img src="/assets/images/bed-presence-mk1/bp-mount-install/5-sensor_extensions.jpg" width="400"/>

1. Fully extend the extension wires, then peel off the adhesive backing on each sensor strip and firmly stick them down.
    - Ensure the sensor strips are approximately centered top to bottom.

    <img src="/assets/images/bed-presence-mk1/bp-mount-install/6-sensor_adhesive.jpg" width="400"/>

1. Gently install the sensor extension clips, inserting the thin side under the slat.
    - Extension wire/sensor strip connector should be approximately centered in the clip.
    - The connectors should click into a cavity, leaving the clips flush with the slat.
    - It’s okay if the slot in the slat does not perfectly align with the slot in the clip.

1. Insert the included zip tie through the slot, tighten it, and trim excess.

1. Connect USB-C power. The unit is now ready to install on top of a box spring, upholstered base, solid platform, or foundation.
    - For beds with wooden slats or platforms, optionally use the provided wood screws to secure the ends of the flexible slat in place.
