# Frequenty Asked Questions

??? question "What kind of USB power supply do I need?"
    Bed Presence Mk1 draws less than 100mA @ 5v. Any high quality USB-A or USB-C power supply that provides continuous
    power will supply adequate power. Some multi-port power supplies may occasionally renegotiate power, causing the
    device to lose power and connection.

    !!! tip
        We recommend using an ETL or UL listed power supply, since fire safety is important in and around beds.
